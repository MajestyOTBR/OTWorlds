# Credits
In lieu of a proper page on the site for this, here's a list of names I wouldn't have been able to build OTWorlds without.

**Tile grid**
Ian Li laid the groundwork for jQuery Infinitedrag, the core feature that the map is rendered with. Since it was released, I've been maintaining [a fork](https://github.com/Sleavely/jquery-infinite-drag) that contains updates from other users than Ian.

**Multiplayer**
[TogetherJS](https://togetherjs.com/) makes for about 90% of the multiplayer feature so thanks for that, Mozilla!

**Colt McAnlis and Paul Lewis**
On the topic of performance, these guy taught me basically everything I know about optimizing for performance in the browser.

**OT file formats**
Without these open-sourced projects to look at and use, I would never have understood how the OTB and OTBM formats work:
- [shdpl/libotbm](https://github.com/shdpl/libotbm)
- [opentibia/item-editor](https://github.com/opentibia/item-editor)
- [hjnilsson/rme](https://github.com/hjnilsson/rme)
- [HexEdit.js](http://hexedit.duttke.de/)
Additionally, I'd like to give my thanks to *wrzasq* for his work on POT. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a repository to link to.

**Sprites**
[gesior/Gesior2012_Additional_Scripts](https://github.com/gesior/Gesior2012_Additional_Scripts) and [rocketeerbkw/yatfot.me](https://github.com/rocketeerbkw/yatfot.me/tree/master/yasde) really helped with extraction from Tibia.spr.

**Hosting**
DigitalOcean provides me with a cheap, stable, and blazing fast server. On top of that CloudFlare graciously lends their CDN for free.

**Laravel**
Writing the backend from scratch would just be too much.

**Other**
HubSpot wrote *Offline.js* and *vex*, two auxilliary (but very useful) components in the UI.
